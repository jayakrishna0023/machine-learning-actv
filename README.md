Machine Learning Techniques GitHub Activity programs

## 1. Analyzing Student Performance
**Scenario:** You are analyzing factors that affect student performance in a standardized test. You collect data on study hours, attendance rates, and socioeconomic background.  
**Question:** How would you set up your linear regression model? What considerations would you make regarding the interpretation of coefficients in this context?

## 2. Time Series Data
**Scenario:** You have monthly data on electricity consumption over several years and want to predict future consumption based on trends and seasonal patterns.  
**Question:** Can linear regression be effectively used in this scenario? If so, how would you incorporate time as a variable in your model?

## 3. Evaluating Marketing Strategies
**Scenario:** A marketing team has created a decision tree to evaluate different advertising strategies for a new product launch.  
**Question:** How would you assess the effectiveness of the current decision tree structure? What specific metrics or outcomes would you analyze to determine if any adjustments are necessary?

## 4. Financial Investment Decisions
**Scenario:** An investment firm uses a decision tree to analyze potential investment opportunities based on market trends and economic indicators.  
**Question:** What process would you follow to update the decision tree as market conditions change? How would you visualize these changes for clarity among team members?

## 5. Disease Diagnosis
**Scenario:** A healthcare provider uses patient data (symptoms, age, medical history) to diagnose diseases using K-NN.  
**Question:** What considerations should you take into account when choosing the value of $K$? How would you ensure that the model is robust against overfitting?

## 6. Image Classification
**Scenario:** You are developing an application that classifies images of animals (e.g., cats vs. dogs) using K-NN.  
**Question:** Given the high dimensionality of image data, what techniques could you use to optimize the performance of K-NN? How would you measure the accuracy of your model?

## 7. Credit Risk Assessment
**Scenario:** A bank uses logistic regression to determine the probability of a loan applicant defaulting on their loan based on their credit score, income level, and employment status.  
**Question:** How would you interpret the coefficients of your logistic regression model in this context? What implications do these coefficients have for risk assessment?

## 8. Email Classification
**Scenario:** You are tasked with building a spam filter using SVM to classify emails as either "spam" or "not spam."  
**Question:** How would you decide between using a linear SVM and a non-linear SVM for this classification problem? What features would you consider important for your model?

## 9. Real Estate Price Prediction
**Scenario:** A real estate company wants to predict house prices based on features like location, size, and number of bedrooms.  
**Question:** If your model's R-squared value is 0.85, what does this indicate about the model's performance? Are there any limitations to using R-squared as the sole metric?

## 10. Gene Expression Analysis
**Scenario:** In a biological study, researchers have collected gene expression data from thousands of genes across multiple samples.  
**Question:** How would PCA help in identifying key patterns or variations in gene expression? What challenges might arise when interpreting the principal components?

## 11. Weather Prediction
**Scenario:** You create a simple linear regression model to predict daily temperatures based on historical weather data.  
**Question:** If your predictions are consistently inaccurate because they do not capture seasonal variations, what does this indicate about bias? How might you improve your model's accuracy?

## 12. Predicting Credit Card Fraud
**Scenario:** A financial institution is using logistic regression to identify fraudulent transactions based on transaction amount, location, and user behavior.  
**Question:** In setting up your data pipeline, how would you ensure that the model is trained on balanced classes? What techniques could you employ to address class imbalance?
